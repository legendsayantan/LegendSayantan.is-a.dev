# Xcrypt

## Reclaim your Privacy.
Xcrypt is a Seamless way to Encrypt or Decrypt local files, on Anroid or Windows.

## Why Xcrypt?

- Xcrypt operates fully offline, no data ever leaves your phone or computer. No analytics data is collected. The primary goal is to protect your privacy, not to invade it.

- Simply convert files to the encrypted or decrypted form of them for single file or bulk, both easy to work with.

- Xcrypt doesn't store the file in some kind of "private" folder, rather keeps it at its original location. So you never lose the encrypted files even if you uninstall Xcrypt.

- Xcrypt is cross-compatible, it's entirely possible to encrypt a file from one device, share to another device then decrypt there using the same key. Even from Android to Windows and vice versa.

- Xcrypt autosaves the file paths you encrypt, and also the 16 digit encryption key to relieve you of the hassle of remembering yourself.

- Want to decrypt a file to use once, or encrypt to share just for once? Xcrypt Single File Operation Mode makes it easier with features like auto deletion.

## Use cases
- Hide files from other people, as simple as that.

- Stop suspicious apps from accessing all your files and reading the contents of your confidential documents.

- Encrypt files before sharing to someone, to prevent access to third parties or any middle-mans .
